I have created this dice game application using jQuery, HTML and CSS
This game is about, there are two players and they have each die for each.
whenever I refresh the screen a random number has been generated and its assigning a random image from the Image folder.
Depends on the random number, I'm changing the title as which player wins.
If the player 1 get the higher random number, the title says "Player 1 wins".
